### **C9 and Hugo**

One of the big hurdles that a developer has to go through when learning something new is the time it takes to set everything up. 

The developer environment setup definitely takes time, but the time to learn the basics of the static site generator also has to be taken into account

Fortunately, since this Personal blog site of mine is simply going to be static site then I thought it would be a good idea to use the cloud IDE C9. C9 provides free *public* workspaces and paid *private* workspaces. Since this website is a simple static website generated by Hugo then it's okay for the source code to be publicly available.

With C9, I'll be able to blog and update my website from any computer without the need to go through the whole setup every time I'm on a different computer.
